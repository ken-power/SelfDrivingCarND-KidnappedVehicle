# Kidnapped Vehicle Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) program. 

Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

The goal of this project is to implement a 2-dimensional particle filter in C++. The  particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data.
